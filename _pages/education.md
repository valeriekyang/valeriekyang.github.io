Why this works better:

    {: .align-left width="100px"}: This is special Jekyll code. It tells the theme: "Put this image on the left, make it small, and wrap the text around it automatically."

    <br style="clear:both;">: This simple line forces the "Engineering Coursework" section to start below the logo, so the layout doesn't get messy if the window is resized.

    No complex HTML: It is almost pure Markdown, which is what Jekyll handles best.
