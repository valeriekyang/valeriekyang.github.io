### Intro

Hi, I'm Valerie. I am currently an undergrad at the **University of Pennsylvania** studying Electrical Engineering and Economics through the **Jerome Fisher Program in Mangement & Technology**.

After graduation, I will begin my PhD in experimental quantum hardware. My research experience is primarily in cryogenic readout and device characterisation for silicon spin qubits. I have work experience in quantitative finance.

### Interests

In my free time, you can find me: 
* Reading (check out my bookshelf!).
* Weightlifting.
* (Trying) to ski.
